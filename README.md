# cd5-scrna

Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of naive T cells correlated to CD5 expression.

This repository contains all data and code to reproduce our analysis. If you 
want to conduct your own analysis of our data, the file "cd5-scrna.csv.gz"
in the folder "data/" is a good starting point.

If you want to re-create our figures, use the script "main.R" or the provided
Makefile.
